## Hello! ✨

My name is Chlod Aidan Alejandro, and I'm a senior software developer and IT manager at my own home. You can call me whatever you want, be it "Chlod", "Aidan", 「アレハンドロ」, or just straight up "dude".

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
A lot of things. I put them on a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/NAr4XDX8/my-projects) to keep things organized. Although you might know me from a few of my projects:
* [Ralsei Bot](https://ralsei.chlod.net) - a Discord bot themed around Ralsei, a character from the game DELTARUNE. The source is private, but I do have the source on GitHub.
* [RedWarn](https://gitlab.com/redwarn/redwarn-web) - a user-friendly Wikipedia counter-vandalism tool. Its source is available on GitLab.
* [Powerhouse](https://github.com/ChlodAlejandro/powerhouse) - an in-development file distribution server made with PHP (which I half-regret).
* Care, a self-care app that I'm making for Research class.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
Calculus and phyletics, as part of my school curriculum. Jokes aside, I'm currently sticking to TypeScript as my language of choice, and I'm not focusing on any other language for the time being. However, as part of my school curriculum (again), I'll be learning Python this year. I've worked with Python before, but I haven't really gotten that in-depth with it.

### 💬 Ask me about ...
Anything under the sun. If you have some code issues that I can probably solve within 10 minutes, don't be afraid to ask.

### 📫 How to reach me
I suggest that you use whatever method you prefer, although I also prefer having things organized.
* If it's Wikipedia-related, please bring it to my [talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chlod).

### ⚡ Fun Fact
* There's a meowing duck at the bottom of the homepage for [Amazon](https://amazon.com).
* I am a sucker for romance media. 「[君の膵臓をたべたい](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Eat_Your_Pancreas)」 made me bawl like an absolute baby.
* [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript)'s transpiler is written entirely in TypeScript.
* You can install [`node`](https://www.nodejs.org) with [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node), but it only works if you have Node already.
* PHP is a recursive acronym, because PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
