## Hello! ‚ú®

My name is Chlod Aidan Alejandro, and I'm a senior software developer and IT manager at my own home. You can call me whatever you want, be it "Chlod", "Aidan", „Äå„Ç¢„É¨„Éè„É≥„Éâ„É≠„Äç, or just straight up "dude".

### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...
A lot of things. I put them on a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/NAr4XDX8/my-projects) to keep things organized. Although you might know me from a few of my projects:
* [Ralsei Bot](https://ralsei.chlod.net) - a Discord bot themed around Ralsei, a character from the game DELTARUNE. The source is private, but I do have the source on GitHub.
* [Ultraviolet](https://gitlab.com/redwarn/ultraviolet) - a user-friendly Wikipedia counter-vandalism tool. Its source is available on GitLab.
* [PAGASA Parser](https://pagasa.chlod.net) - a library that parses information from [PAGASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAGASA)'s Tropical Cyclone Bulletin page and turns it into various formats.
* [JTWC Archiver](https://wiki.chlod.net/jtwc) - an automatic archive of all Joint Typhoon Warning Center warnings and products.
* [Deputy](https://github.com/ChlodAlejandro/deputy) - a copyright investigation suite for Wikipedia.

### üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
Computer Engineering at [Map√∫a University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map√∫a_University). Jokes aside, I'm currently sticking to TypeScript as my language of choice, and I'm not focusing on any other language for the time being. I do wish to learn Rust at some point.

### üí¨ Ask me about ...
Anything under the sun. If you have some code issues that I can probably solve within 10 minutes, don't be afraid to ask. If you need anime recommendations or Japanese language learning resources, I'll be happy to give you some. If you want me to tell you how to learn a language... well that's pushing the boundaries a bit.

### üì´ How to reach me
I suggest that you use whatever method you prefer, although I also prefer having things organized.
* If it's Wikipedia-related, please bring it to my [talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chlod).
* For security issues regarding any of my projects, you can send me an email at [chlod@chlod.net](mailto:chlod@chlod.net).
* If you're a close friend just wanting some attention, you can just call me on my phone number.
* For other concerns, you can tweet at me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChlodAlejandro).

### üòÑ Pronouns
He/him.
